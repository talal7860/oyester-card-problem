- Use Node Version 6.1.0
- Use Yarn
- When in this project do yarn install
- yarn run test to make sure everything is working perfectly
- index.js has all of the business logic to calculate the fare
******* Assumptions ********
- Although the card system works such that the maximum fare is charged when a user swipes in a station. But in our case I assumed that a user always successfully swipes in and swipes out. And I've assumed that we never needed to view the balance during a trip because we just provide the start and end and we do our calculations assuming that everything has been completed successfully.
- All the test cases are written in the test folder with sample fixtures. The assumptions are quite straight forward and it can be deducted easily from the code.
